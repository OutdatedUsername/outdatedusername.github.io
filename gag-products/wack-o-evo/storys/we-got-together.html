We went to her house to ask Anna how helpful WHAK-O games helped her meet her husband.<br><b>How did you meet?(Anna)</b><br>Well when I was in like the libary one day, I saw a man strolling past me, he looked a little shy, I felt a little bit lonley, because I had a WHAK-O game with me, I asked everyone to play it with me, but noone would, I was about to cry, then he walked up to me and played the game, and suprisingly, we had a <b>VERY</b> good time playing the game, then, I felt the love that we were right for each other.
<br><b>How did you meet?(Joe)</b><br>Well I was strolling though the libary when all of the sudden I saw someone crying, and begging me to play the game with her, well, it was a WHAK-O game, one of my favorite, so I felt like I had to play one of those, it was <a href="https://outdatedusername.github.io/gag-products/wack-o/hay-in-a-needle-stack">Hay In A Needle Stack</a>, I felt the love coming to me, it felt very weird, but at least I got a game night in.<br><div style="color:blue">With that awesome game night, we shoud expect more to come, so we asked both of them if they are ever gonna host a game night agian.</div><b>When are you going to host your next game night?(Anna)</b><br>I don't know, but I think Joe has been begging me to play a WHAK-O game ever since we met, it's been weirding me out ever since.<br>
<b>When are you going to host your next game night?(Joe)</b><br>I hope it is VERY VERY SOON, because Anna keeps declining my offer to play the game which helped us meet...<br>While waiting for them, how about you get our <a href="https://outdatedusername.github.io/gag-products/wack-o/hay-in-a-needle-stack">Hay in A Needle Stack</a>, which made this story true.
